abstract = {A recognition scheme that scales efficiently to a large number of objects is presented. The efficiency and quality is exhibited in a live demonstration that recognizes CD-covers from a database of 40000 images of popular music CD\&amp;\#146;s. The scheme builds upon popular techniques of indexing descriptors extracted from local regions, and is robust to background clutter and occlusion. The local region descriptors are hierarchically quantized in a vocabulary tree. The vocabulary tree allows a larger and more discriminatory vocabulary to be used efficiently, which we show experimentally leads to a dramatic improvement in retrieval quality. The most significant property of the scheme is that the tree directly defines the quantization. The quantization and the indexing are therefore fully integrated, essentially being one and the same. The recognition quality is evaluated through retrieval on a database with ground truth, showing the power of the vocabulary tree approach, going as high as 1 million images.},

This book explains and explores the principal techniques of Data Mining: for classification, generation of association rules and clustering. It is written for readers without a strong background in mathematics or statistics and focuses on detailed examples and explanations of the algorithms given. This should prove of value to readers of all kinds, from those whose only use of data mining techniques will be via commercial packages right through to academic researchers. This book aims to help the general reader develop the necessary understanding to use commercial data mining packages discriminatingly, as well as enabling the advanced reader to understand or contribute to future technical advances in the field. Each chapter has practical exercises to enable readers to check their progress. A full glossary of technical terms used is included.},

@article{Lin2014,
abstract = {In image retrieval, the image feature is the main factor determining accuracy; the color feature is the most important feature and is most commonly used with a K-means algorithm. To create a fast K-means algorithm for this study, first a level histogram of statistics for the image database is made. The level histogram is used with the K-means algorithm for clustering data. A fast K-means algorithm not only shortens the length of time spent on training the image database cluster centers, but it also overcomes the cluster center re-training problem since large numbers of images are continuously added into the database. For the experiment, we use gray and color image database sets for performance comparisons and analyzes, respectively. The results show that the fast K-means algorithm is more effective, faster, and more convenient than the traditional K-means algorithm. Moreover, it overcomes the problem of spending excessive amounts of time on re-training caused by the continuous addition of images to the image database. Selection of initial cluster centers also affects the performance of cluster center training.},

@article{Sivic2006,
abstract = {We describe an approach to object retrieval which searches for and localizes all the occurrences of an object in a video, given a query image of the object. The object is represented by a set of viewpoint invariant region descriptors so that recognition can proceed successfully despite changes in viewpoint, illumination and partial occlusion. The temporal continuity of the video within a shot is used to track the regions in order to reject those that are unstable. Efficient retrieval is achieved by employing methods from statistical text retrieval, including inverted file systems, and text and document frequency weightings. This requires a visual analogy of a word which is provided here by vector quantizing the region descriptors. The final ranking also depends on the spatial layout of the regions. The result is that retrieval is immediate, returning a ranked list of shots in the manner of Google. We report results for object retrieval on the full length feature films ‘Groundhog Day’ and ‘Casablanca’.},

abstract = {Web mining aims to discover useful information and knowledge from Web hyperlinks, page contents, and usage data. Although Web mining uses many conventional data mining techniques, it is not purely an application of traditional data mining due to the semi-structured and unstructured nature of the Web data. The field has also developed many of its own algorithms and techniques. Liu has written a comprehensive text on Web mining, which consists of two parts. The first part covers the data mining and machine learning foundations, where all the essential concepts and algorithms of data mining and machine learning are presented. The second part covers the key topics of Web mining, where Web crawling, search, social network analysis, structured data extraction, information integration, opinion mining and sentiment analysis, Web usage mining, query log mining, computational advertising, and recommender systems are all treated both in breadth and in depth. His book thus brings all the related concepts and algorithms together to form an authoritative and coherent text. The book offers a rich blend of theory and practice. It is suitable for students, researchers and practitioners interested in Web mining and data mining both as a learning text and as a reference book. Professors can readily use it for classes on data mining, Web mining, and text mining. Additional teaching materials such as lecture slides, datasets, and implemented algorithms are available online.},

abstract = {Our ability to generate and collect data has been increasing rapidly. Not only are all of our business, scientific, and government transactions now computerized, but the widespread use of digital cameras, publication tools, and bar codes also generate data. On the collection side, scanned text and image platforms, satellite remote sensing systems, and the World Wide Web have flooded us with a tremendous amount of data. This explosive growth has generated an even more urgent need for new techniques and automated tools that can help us transform this data into useful information and knowledge.Like the first edition, voted the most popular data mining book by KD Nuggets readers, this book explores concepts and techniques for the discovery of patterns hidden in large data sets, focusing on issues relating to their feasibility, usefulness, effectiveness, and scalability. However, since the publication of the first edition, great progress has been made in the development of new data mining methods, systems, and applications. This new edition substantially enhances the first edition, and new chapters have been added to address recent developments on mining complex types of data— including stream data, sequence data, graph structured data, social network data, and multi-relational data.Whether you are a seasoned professional or a new student of data mining, this book has much to offer you:* A comprehensive, practical look at the concepts and techniques you need to know to get the most out of real business data.* Updates that incorporate input from readers, changes in the field, and more material on statistics and machine learning.* Dozens of algorithms and implementation examples, all in easily understood pseudo-code and suitable for use in real-world, large-scale data mining projects.* Complete classroom support for instructors at www.mkp.com/datamining2e companion site.},
